## Properties

### resolvedLinks

```ts
resolvedLinks: Record<string, Record<string, number>>
```

Contains all resolved links. This object maps each source file's path to an object of destination file paths with the link count.
Source and destination paths are all vault absolute paths that comes from `TFile.path` and can be used with `Vault.getAbstractFileByPath(path)`.

### unresolvedLinks

```ts
unresolvedLinks: Record<string, Record<string, number>>
```

Contains all unresolved links. This object maps each source file to an object of unknown destinations with count.
Source paths are all vault absolute paths, similar to `resolvedLinks`.

## Methods

### getFirstLinkpathDest

```ts
getFirstLinkpathDest(linkpath: string, sourcePath: string): TFile | null;
```

Get the best match for a linkpath.

### getFileCache

```ts
getFileCache(file: TFile): CachedMetadata | null;
```

### getCache

```

### fileToLinktext

```ts
fileToLinktext(file: TFile, sourcePath: string, omitMdExtension?: boolean): string;
